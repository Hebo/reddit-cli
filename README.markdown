reddit-cli
==========

reddit-cli is a tool that lets you browse reddit.com and follow links from a command line shell. reddit-cli supports subreddits and even has a boss key!

Keys:

 * `o` or `Enter` : open link in system default webbrowser
 * `O` : open link in lynx
 * `q` : quit
 * `b` : boss mode (executes `man python` by default)
 * `u` : refresh
 * `s` : open subreddit


While unfinished at present, reddit-cli will eventually allow you to:

 * read comments

Requirements:

 * python 2.7
 * lynx if you want the ability to open links with it
 * "light on dark" terminal color scheme
